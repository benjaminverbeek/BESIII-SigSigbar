Hello, this is my vim practise document.

I have never worked with vim before (as of 2022-11-09), but as a
total nerd, I have ofcourse heard of it and watched videos.

Nor do I typically use Unix or Linux. I want to learn though.

LEARNT SO FAR:
i	- insert mode
esc	- command mode
x	- delete marked 
u	- undo last command
U	- undo entire line
A	- append text at end of line (changes to insert mode)
:wq	- save and exit... (hypothesis: w-write q-quit?)
testing just :q -- it actually catches it as an error if not written
since last change. Adding ! ovverides, i.e. :q! - quit without saving
:w does indeed save (write)
CTRL-R	- redo last change
